# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

Users can compose Tweets with a maximum of 140 characters, which instantly appear at the top of the scrolling page upon submission. The interface offers the option to hide or display the new tweet section by clicking on "Write a new tweet" or the arrows below. Additionally, a handy button appears in the bottom right corner, enabling users to effortlessly scroll back to the top of the page as they navigate.
